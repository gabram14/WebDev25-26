    <!-- Challenge 2: Create a heading, h1 for Web Technologies -->
    <h1>Web Technologies</h1>
    
    <!-- Challenge 3: Create a heading, h3 for HTML -->
    <h3> Hypertext Markup Language</h3>
    <!-- Challenge 4: Create a paragraph explaining what is HTML. At least 3 sentences. -->
    <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the World Wide Web. 
      It uses a system of elements and tags to define the various parts of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. 
      Web browsers interpret this markup to display the content in a readable and organized format for users.</p>

    <h3> Cascading Style Sheets </h3>
    <!-- Challenge 6: Create a paragraph explaining what is CSS.  At least 3 sentences. -->
    <p>CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is a stylesheet language used to describe the visual presentation and formatting of a document written in HTML.
    It controls the design aspects of a website, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and layout, separately from the actual content.
     By separating content and style, CSS allows developers to efficiently manage the look of multiple web pages at once, making sites easier to maintain and faster to load</p>

    <!-- Challenge 7: Create a heading, h3 for JavaScript -->
    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
    <!-- Challenge 8: Create a paragraph explaining what is JavaScript.  At least 3 sentences. -->
    <p>JavaScript is a versatile programming language used to create dynamic and interactive content on web pages. 
    While HTML and CSS control a website's structure and style, JavaScript adds the interactive behavior, such as animations, 
    clickable menus, and dynamic content updates. It can be used for both front-end (browser-based) and back-end (server-based) development through technologies</p>
