     <a href="https://javascript.info/" target="_blank"></a><p>JavaScript is a high-level, multi-paradigm programming language primarily known for enabling interactive and dynamic content on web pages.
     It operates both client-side, within web browsers, and server-side, through runtimes like Node.js, allowing for the creation of full-stack web applications.
     JavaScript supports object-oriented, functional, and imperative programming styles, featuring dynamic typing, a rich set of built-in objects and methods, and a syntax largely based on C and Java.
     Its core functionality revolves around manipulating HTML and CSS, handling user events, updating content asynchronously, and communicating with servers to enhance the user experience.
